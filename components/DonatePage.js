				Foothills supports many local Dandenong Ranges families and individuals throughout the year
				with meals and food support. This year alone they have distributed over 25,000 meals to
				locals in need of an extra hand up. Each Christmas they host a special Christmas Day Lunch
				for people who would otherwise be on their own.
