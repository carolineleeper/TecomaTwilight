Elizabeth McFarlane was humming before she could talk. She learnt to read from the Seekers lyrics book. She originates from a musical family, growing up in the Dandenong Ranges amidst musical gatherings and festivals. Her formal training spans specialist voice work and a degree in musical theatre. Elizabeth works professionally in bands around Australia, including Miss Lizzy and the Night Owls, where her original compositions and powerful voice has blown audiences away. She has shared the stage with Mahalia Barnes, Claire Bowditch and Brian Nankervis.

Elizabeth is also a dedicated teacher of voice and music theatre where here greatest pleasure is seeing her students develop both vocally and personally.

Over Covid lockdown, Liz has been recording with her 'household' in Kallista comprising partner Cam Fallaw, Dad Dave McFarlane and cousin Jordan Scotney. See those videos in the "listen while you shop" tab below, they're so good!
