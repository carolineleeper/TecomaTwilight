Tina Nabb is a born storyteller, who only came to song writing after picking up a ukulele once the kids left home. After honing her skills at singalongs, festival jams and open mic sessions for a few years, she won the Minstrel competition at the Maldon Folk Festival in 2015. This came with a prize of gigs at the 2016 festival, which is where Tina successfully launched her CD, ‘Town and Country’ - which is not a country album. The title track pays homage to the joys of living in Upper Ferntree Gully ‘with a mountain in my backyard and a highway at my gate’.

Sometimes reflective, other times hilarious, Tina’s song writing draws deeply on her observations of human nature and addresses a wide range of subjects from cyber bullying (CTRL + ALT + DELETE) to how living with teenagers can drive you crazy (Hissy Fit).

For all enquiries, or to purchase Tina’s CD for \$15.00 including postage, please contact <christinanabb@hotmail.com> for payment details.
