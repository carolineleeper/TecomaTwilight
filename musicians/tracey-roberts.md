Tracey Roberts is a talented, accomplished and versatile singer-songwriter-pianist with jazz-infused folk-pop style songs which are melodic and inspiring, sprinkled with hints of blues, cabaret and soulful grooves. She is gifted with dynamic vocals, passionately delivering performances with a refreshing honesty, energy and sense of humour that consistently mesmerises her audiences. 20 years of international musical experience includes touring, TV and radio, regular performances at concerts, functions and festivals. Her 10th CD, LIVE at the LARK, has just been released with her Quartet a joyful and dynamic album of originals and carefully selected covers. Tracey Roberts works in various combos comprising top class musicians, from a duo (with drums), up to a quintet (adding guitar, horns and/or bass). The result is a joyful, vibrant jazz-funk groove based sound, refreshingly honest and entertaining. Dynamic, sophisticated and lyrical songs include re-stylised jazz and pop standards performed with spontaneous riffs, killer vocals, much merry-making and experienced, polished musicianship. She also writes and performs a juicy selection of her own songs from her 10 CD recordings. A class act.
