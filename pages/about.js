					, and do all your gift shopping here. Weâ€™ve made it even easier for you to give good gifts
					this year with our curated Ethical Gift Buying Guide which launches on November 19th. Sign
					up on the home page to be the first to receive it when it launches.

					And why not consider not only purchasing good gifts, but giving a gift! Foothills
					Community Care supports many local Dandenong Ranges families and individuals throughout

					Lunch for people who would otherwise be on their own.

				<p className="textCenter">
					This year you are invited to donate towards the Foothills Community Care Christmas Appeal.
					You can do this in one of two ways:
				</p>
				<p className="textBox">
					Donate gifts towards the Foothills Giving Tree. These gifts will go towards their
					Christmas care-packages to local families in need of some extra support this Christmas.
					Simply order your gift and drop it at Tecoma Uniting Church, 1566 Burwood Highway, Tecoma
					before Tuesday December 15th.
				</p>
				<p className="textBox">
					Donate funds to them to help their support of vulnerable and isolated people this
					Christmas. All donations over $2 are tax-deductible and can be made securely via the
					Donate button above.
				</p>
				<p className="upperCase">
					Thank you for supporting these wonderful businesses, and for sharing the love through
					ethical gifts this year!
