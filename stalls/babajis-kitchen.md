description: "We're Babajis Kitchen, Belgrave's South Indian village cooks.  \r\n\r\nOur 'Picnics in the Forest' are inspired by hot summers spent relaxing in Indian ‘hill stations’, escaping the heat and connecting with nature.\r\n\r\nFrom Indian influenced baguettes, salads, dips, Indian street food dishes, regional cheeses, olives & craft beer, our hampers are freshly made to order and packed into handcrafted & fair trade colourful Burmese Pali baskets."
ethicalDescription: "Our team are great cooks, self taught by their mums and grandmothers before them.   But how we get that food to YOU is important to us.   We believe, that the take away industry has a responsibility to minimise the waste it produces by using compostable packaging (despite its much greater cost to us), sourcing local produce and inviting you to BYO containers.   \r\n\r\nIt's been a tough year for us and our staff. Many of our staff, not being permanent residents have not been entitled to Jobkeeper subsidies. For them, it is not only about supporting themselves in Australia but also supporting their families in far worse situations in India & Nepal. \r\n\r\nWe can proudly say we have kept all these staff members employed throughout Covid, without government assistance and with the support of our community. \r\n\r\nIt's true. We serve delicious food. But we hope you can taste the love & compassion that goes into it."
