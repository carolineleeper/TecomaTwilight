description: "We're Babajis Kitchen, Belgrave's South Indian village cooks.  \r

  \r

  Our 'Picnics in the Forest' are inspired by hot summers spent relaxing in
  Indian ‘hill stations’, escaping the heat and connecting with nature.\r

  \r

  From Indian influenced baguettes, salads, dips, Indian street food dishes,
  regional cheeses, olives & craft beer, our hampers are freshly made to order
  and packed into handcrafted & fair trade colourful Burmese Pali baskets."
ethicalDescription: "Our team are great cooks, self taught by their mums and
  grandmothers before them.   But how we get that food to YOU is important to
  us.   We believe, that the take away industry has a responsibility to minimise
  the waste it produces by using compostable packaging (despite its much greater
  cost to us), sourcing local produce and inviting you to BYO containers.   \r

  \r

  It's been a tough year for us and our staff. Many of our staff, not being
  permanent residents have not been entitled to Jobkeeper subsidies. For them,
  it is not only about supporting themselves in Australia but also supporting
  their families in far worse situations in India & Nepal. \r

  \r

  We can proudly say we have kept all these staff members employed throughout
  Covid, without government assistance and with the support of our community. \r

  \r

  It's true. We serve delicious food. But we hope you can taste the love &
  compassion that goes into it."
