description: "All Blissful Nature soap & skincare is handmade with love & locally sourced materials where possible. Flowers, fruit & foliage are harvested from my garden, slowly steeped in quality oils to give your skin nourishing bliss. \r\nTraditional cold pressed methods are used to make my soap, curing time depends on the temperature/weather. \r\nMost of my range of soap is vegan but all the lip balms do contain locally sourced bees wax."
ethicalDescription: "All raw materials I buy are carefully chosen for quality, as local as possible, support small businesses, chemical free, and gentle on Mother Earth. All the packaging I receive is shredded to be used in gift boxes, composted, returned or recycled. \r\nI am passionate about making nurturing Palm Oil Free skincare. I support The Orangutan Project with money from each market I take part in via their adoption program to rescue & rehabilitate beautiful orangutans ?"
