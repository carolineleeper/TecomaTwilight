  - product_name: CYL Deluxe Avocado Night Replenishment Cream
    product_description: "Our deluxe cream for those that value deep hydration. Our
      richest cream in the range that will totally replenish the skin
      overnight.\r

      \r

      The Avocado oil is rich in vitamin A & D to which we have added
      additional Natural Tocopherol (Vit E) as well as extra beta-carotene from
      Carrot CO2 extract. So it is packed with anti-oxidants.\r

      \r

      The rich combination of Shea, Babassu and Cocoa Butters nourish the
      skin deeply and with the help of the phytosterols the replenishment of
      collagen can be encouraged. The high lauric acid content of Babassu Butter
      has antibacterial benefits to the skin.\r

      \r

      A blend of essential oils not only provides care to the skin but
      also creates a soft and exquisite perfume."

  - product_name: CYL Shea Butter
    product_description: "The most beautiful and versatile shea butter from Uganda!
      In contrast to the harder white shea from West Africa, this softer light
      yellow shea butter from East Africa is easy to spread in your palms, has a
      sweeter aroma and has a significantly higher olein content which makes it
      luxuriously softer with a creamier texture.\r

      \r

      We buy it directly from our Ugandan friends that live in Melbourne
      and have put us in contact with this source. They in turn support the
      R.A.I.S.E Institute which provides the Ugandan youth with the practical
      skills, the personal growth, the financial means and the motivation to
      make them either more employable or successful entrepreneurs."

    product_description: "We LOVE calendula, it is the most beautiful, radiant,
      happy and helpful plant and we love growing it in our herb garden.\r

      Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is an astringent and decongestant
      which means that it will help to tighten and unblock skin. Calendula is
      also well known for its' soothing properties.\r

      Our cream gets the best from our homegrown calendula petals by
      steeping them first in water and straining this for the water phase whilst

      the oil phase. This combination gives the most potent result."
