ethicalDescription: "Happily Made believes that women in Cambodia need our trade....not aid. Creating home based jobs so that the women can stay home with their families and make a flexible income is our priority. We try to leave as little of an environmental footprint as possible with all our treasures being made by hand and our textiles are dyed with natural colours that don't contaminate the local waterways."
