description: "We offer eco-friendly home and personal care product refills in BYO and upcycled containers through markets, deliveries and even self-collection options.  We decant bulk shampoos, conditioners, hand/body washes, kitchen and laundry powders along with many multi-purpose cleaners into your clean reusable containers at home that would otherwise be thrown away into the rubbish or recycle bins.  We also offer locally made specialty bath salts, natural tooth powders and clay face masks along with many raw powder ingredients to make up your own natural products at home."
ethicalDescription: "We advocate reusing (instead of recycling) plastic and glass containers throughout our community for multiple purposes, and we source ethical products from bulk wholesale manufacturers with the view to maintaining to our best ability that same principle.  Whether itâ€™s plant based ingredients with no formaldehyde, no petrochemicals or animals products used, grey water and septic system safe or working with suppliers who allow us to return bulk containers to be reused (therefore contributing both to less 'food miles' as they're local, and less plastic back up the supply chain as well).  Our aim is to be purchase conscious not only of the footprint of our products from us to you, but from the supplier to us as well."
