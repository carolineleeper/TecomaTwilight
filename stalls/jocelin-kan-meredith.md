description: "Jocelin Meredith, is a Melbourne based artist who has reconnected with her artist's soul - printmaking and discovering a love for ink drawings. \nThrough her artwork, she explores themes of humanity - the challenges, influences, and tensions that leave imprints on a person's spirit. \n\nShe draws on nature and ordinary objects for inspiration to symbolise the value in the invaluable, complex meanings and emotions that hold multiple perspectives. \n\nEach print is signed, numbered and includes an inscription detailing a short narrative about the piece and a certificate to validate that the printing conforms to archival standards."
ethicalDescription: "Jocelin hopes the human soul connects vulnerably with different elements of her drawing. And sparks interaction and conversation amongst the audience with an opportunity for storytelling, healing and a holistic understanding of each other."
