ethicalDescription: "Karen Stokes Design specialises in creating one of a kind, quality jewellery out of polymer clay. Her designs are considered to be part of the slow fashion movement which celebrates products that are made to last and promotes purchasing items which are not mass produced and end up in landfill. \r\n\r\nEach of the designs that are made are handmade and with her new line of jewellery there are hand painted pieces available too. These pieces are wearable art as each piece is unique. \r\n\r\nKaren prides herself on the fact that all the earrings are created out of polymer clay and she uses every piece of clay to ensure that there is no wastage."
