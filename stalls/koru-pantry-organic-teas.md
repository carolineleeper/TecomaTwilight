description: "Sisters Kerry and Kylie brought together their diverse but united backgrounds - in food, health, yoga, nourishment and education - to \ncreate Koru Pantry. The journey began with Mistress of Spice Chai  - a drink much loved by Kerry’s yoga students. With Kylie’s capacity to track down just about anything, they were soon sourcing quality organic ingredients from around the world to bring Kerry’s creations to life. They are passionate about encouraging people to once more value the process of nourishing themselves – of setting aside the time for self care and valuing the rituals that encourage connection in the process, cultivating a deep and sustaining happiness. They encourage you to buy a beautiful teapot, and make time to drink tea with the people you love, in a way that sets the stage for conversation and connection."
ethicalDescription: "In establishing Koru we felt it was crucial to ensure we sourced organic ingredients,  from suppliers who valued fair trade practices. Our approach has been to collaborate with other small local businesses whenever possible to directly support families making a living for themselves. To make choices in packaging that are as eco friendly as we possibly can. And most importantly, to create a product that offers nourishment and comfort."
