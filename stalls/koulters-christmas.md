description: "Here at Koulters Christmas we sell 3 different varieties of locally grown, live potted Christmas trees and various handmade beaded decorations.\r\nWe are a young family located in Monbulk in the beautiful Dandenong ranges.\r\nBrhydi is a horticulturist who specialised in native indigenous plants before becoming a stay at home mum to our 2 boys. Sam also works in the industry and plants are a big part of our lives.\r\nNormally at this time of year our young family would be participating in local markets and fetes, getting involved with the local communities, but we are still excited to be involved in this adaptive way.\r\nWe enjoy providing people with a more ethical Christmas and saving trees from being cut down each year. Our products also make wonderful gifts for the tricky to buy for!"
ethicalDescription: "These locally grown, live potted Christmas trees are a great ethical alternative to cutting down a live tree or putting up a fake plastic tree.\r\nA potted tree is so much more environmentally friendly and can be used again every year, bigger and better than the last. It not only saves carbon from being released back into the atmosphere when a tree is cut down, but instead stores it and reduces the amount of green waste once Christmas is over.\r\nOur beaded Christmas decorations are made from beads that we saved from going into landfill after a business closed down and they were no longer able to store them. We then started making beaded jewellery and Christmas decorations to add to our seasonal stall."
