description: "-Lady Luna Creations-\r\n\r\nUsing eco-friendly mediums and sustainable materials Luna creates art from the heart, whilst channelling universal energy into her work. \r\n\r\nShe loves to forage and press her own flowers, including these in some of her works wherever they choose to go.\r\n\r\nShe also loves to collage bits and pieces of preloved material from her travels around the world into her creations. Luna enjoys working with people on commissions bringing vibrancy to their homes. She has an eye for detail and can suggest pieces from her collection that could compliment any room or will create an entirely new piece just for you ?"
ethicalDescription: "The art world can be fairly wastful and harmful not only for nature but for us creators and those who purchase our work. Luna strives to live in cohesion with nature as best as she can and has sourced complimentary products and mediums that are good quality, toxic free, eco and vegan friendly set by industry standards. She loves to support local where she can, purchasing from Australian suppliers and some of her larger canvases are even made by hand around the corner from her home. She enjoys creating outside and in her studio with the door closed, using no resin in any of her pieces."
