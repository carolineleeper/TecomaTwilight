description: "Yoga teacher Kerry created “little raccoon” almost by accident during Covid times. Turning her hand to mask making, she rediscovered a latent love of fabrics and creativity, and was flooded with requests for beautiful custom masks. She’s extending her range now to include other lines; dog bandanas, gift and produce bags, reusable make up remover pads and cushion covers amongst other things."
