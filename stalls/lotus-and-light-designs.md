description: "One of a kind, handcrafted crystal and organic jewellery designed to celebrate the unique and divine gifts the natural world provides us with. Intentional, slow made and sustainable jewellery to adorn yourself with everyday, connecting you to the natural world and reminding you to live the life of your dreams. I use recycled copper and ethically sourced crystals, feathers and shells in my designs."
ethicalDescription: "We are interconnected with all of the life forms that inhabit this magical place, that we temporarily call home. And I am constantly inspired, in awe of and appreciative of the unique and wonderful world we live within. I have always connected jewellery with my life experiences,  as each piece comes with its own story and memory that I treasure. For this reason, I chose to turn my passion for the natural world and jewellery into a small handmade business. Each piece of jewellery takes 2-4 days to complete, from hand shaping and hammering the ring bands or bezels for the pendants, to choosing and sourcing crystals from ethical sellers. I also use recycled copper for my work to reduce my environmental impact. I  spend time searching for fallen leaves, branches, shed feathers and seashells that I can incorporate into my designs, so all of my organic pieces are completely natural. Nature is a tapestry of inspiring and imaginative artwork, and I use simple designs to showcase the beauty of each crystal or piece of organic material I feature in my work. Each piece of my jewellery is an invitation. To slowdown, appreciate simplicity and be inspired by the wonder of the natural world. I hope my jewellery also becomes a part of your story and holds many treasured memories and moments."

  - product_name: "Chrysocolla Crystal Necklace"
    product_description: "This  delight features a vibrant chrysocolla gemstone set in copper on a dainty copper chain. \r\nThe energy of chrysocolla is that of the goddess, her strength, wisdom and balance.  Bringing the masculine and feminine into alignment, whilst focussing the mind and allowing you to speak your heart. \r\nThe crystal pendant is 3cm long and 1.5cm wide. The copper chain is 44cm long, and sealed to prevent any tarnishing or interaction with the skin.\r\n\r\nI have set this necklace through the process of electroforming. I begin by preparing the crystal and creating the bail for the necklace, which the chain will pass through. Once I am happy with the setting, I paint a conductive paint onto the parts of the crystal I need the copper to plate onto. The next step is protecting the rest of the crystal with a temporary sealant. Once I have completed these steps, I’m finally ready to put the crystal into my electroforming solution, and use electricity to move copper from one place to another. This process can take anywhere from 24-48 hours, and requires constant monitoring to ensure the process is smooth, and does not happen too quickly, as this affects the quality of the plating. Once the piece is ready, I clean it, remove any sealant from the crystal and finally, sand and polish the copper before adding a chain to finish the necklace. \r\n \r\nIt’s quite a process from beginning with a raw crystal, to the finished result and one that I absolutely love. I hope that you treasure your new piece of jewellery for a long time to come."
