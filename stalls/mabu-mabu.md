description: "Mabu Mabu is a saying in the Torres Strait that translates to 'help yourself.' Traditionally, a Mabu Mabu is a banquet, shared table or big family meal. It's how we like to enjoy food on the islands: surrounded by the people we love.\r\n\r\n​We're passionate about native ingredients, and use a variety of Indigenous herbs, fruits, succulents and spices in all of our dishes. We want to help create a truely Australian cuisine by helping people to understand native flavours, and to use them in their every-day cooking."
ethicalDescription: "Mabu Mabu acknowledges the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who have been gathering, growing, harvesting and using Indigenous ingredients for over 60,000 years on the lands now known as Australia, in particular our chef's cultural heritage; the Komet Tribe of the Meriam People of Mer Island in the Torres Strait. \r\nWe are a Torres Strait owned and run business with an emphasis on using fresh, seasonal and native ingredients to create beautiful dishes that bring people together.\r\n\r\n​"
