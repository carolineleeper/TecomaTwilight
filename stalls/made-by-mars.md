description: "Natural well being products made from the earth, made for whatever your body or soul is craving. \r\nTrying to offer a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to single use skincare products by repurposing and recycling packaging when available, refilling jars at a discounted rate & only purchasing new packaging when it can biodegrade or be used time and time again. \r\n\r\nEvery purchase is contributing to ocean clean up projects in Australia and worldwide; alternating organisations each month. We are currently looking into supporting some smaller local causes too! Stay Tuned!\r\n\r\nI try my best to only put the best vibrations into your products! So you better believe there is plenty of dancing, love & intention stirred into every batch!"
ethicalDescription: "Being as kind to the earth as possible is the main reason for creating Made By Mars. Only using biodegradable, reusable or recycled packaging is important in reducing waste. \r\n\r\nEnsuring any ingredient used is cruelty free and trying to use organic as much as possible is important as we want you to be able to use our products guilt free and know there are no hidden nasties going onto your body. We will be a 100% vegan company by the end of 2020 (Just waiting until all current beeswax stock is used up)."
