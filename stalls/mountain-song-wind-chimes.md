description: "Mountain Song is a thriving small business in the Dandenong Ranges, delighting in making wind chimes that have been precisely tuned. Any range from medium to huge can be set to any of our scale or chord suggestions (see/hear website), or we can make and tune them specifically to your requirements. Other options include: windcatcher shape; laser engraving of an inscription using your text, image, and font; five to eight chimes in a set; Australian hardwood parts... you ask, we'll consider it!"
ethicalDescription: "Our Mindful Ethos: If manufacturing for you is simply a matter of peg A into hole B and a quick whack with a hammer, then read no further! If, though, you sense that something of the craftsperson can be embedded in his or her work, that their philosophy finds its way into the end product, then be assured that we 'work mindfully' in the creation of Mountain Song Wind Chimes. In particular, when completing a piece that has been especially commissioned for an occasion, we hold in heart/mind/spirit/prayer ~ whichever word works for you ~ the individual(s) whom the work celebrates. In a mass-produced world it is difficult to grasp and explain exactly why this is importantâ€¦ it just is."
