description: "My Fair Baby grew out of the desire to create a livelihood for families in some of the world's poorest countries. We bring fun and super comfy apparel for babies and kids as well as eco-friendly toys and accessories. Ethically sourced and beautifully made, our products are fair trade, organic and sustainable. All our profits are donated to help the needy. We turned 7 in 2020, celebrating the existence of our small business, making its impact for a fairer world."
