description: "Nevedya is Food for the Spirit. Run by husband and wife duo Daniel Rigos and Shakti Iyer, it is an experience to bring you back to your true self. The food is a cleansing experience of reconnecting to nourishment at its untainted roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe space of Nevedya is a full spectrum sensory experience. There are beautiful smells to greet you, specially curated music, with art and beauty all around.\r\n\r\nThe interior is designed by head chef Shakti Iyer and wood artist Yanni Rigos. There are a variety of different and unique seating experiences from the Arabic style comfy floor seating booths, to the magnificent Californian redwood communal table, to the dog friendly outdoor heated deck set amongst our beautiful permaculture garden.\r\n\r\nWe are located in the magnificent Dandenong Ranges just under an hour from Melbourne. Spectacular nature abounds with cool rainforest walks, quaint towns and alternative vibes."
