It is a non-profit entity with the objective of protecting refugee rights through its campaign activism.\r\n\r\nThe Refugee Action Collective will continue to fight for the human rights of asylum seekers and refugees and calls on the Australian Government to:\r\n\r\n*End mandatory detention of asylum seekers that violates their basic human rights and contravenes UN conventions to which Australia is a signatory\r\n*End all offshore processing of asylum seekers; close Manus, Nauru and Christmas Island detention centres\r\n*Abolish Temporary Protection Visas and provide permanent protection to refugees\r\n*Stop looking for other so called solutions on the soil of sovereign states in our neighbourhood\r\n*Cease deporting asylum seekers to countries where they can face persecution, torture and death\r\n*Urgently remove all children from detention together with their parents to enable them to have a normal childhood and education\r\n*Review all ASIO assessments and cease indefinite detention\r\n*Restore appeal rights to the courts for all asylum seekers\r\n*Compensate all who have suffered as a result of their detention enduring physical and psychological harm\r\n*Fully implement all UN conventions that protect the human rights of asylum seekers"
