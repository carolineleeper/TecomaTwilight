description: "Sushi Express is a local, family business in Belgrave since 2010.  We love being part of this beautiful community and providing sushi lunch orders to many local primary schools in the hills."
ethicalDescription: "We are proud to offer affordable, fresh, healthy, quality Japanese food for our customers.  We also take great pride in being thoughtful in our use of single use packaging and where possible use paper or cardboard and encourage customers to BYO containers - rewarding with a 5% discount.  We see a lot of waste in the hospitality industry so we sort our waste and try to reuse cardboard boxes for large takeaway orders and make our rice bags into re-usable bags for customers.  We try to encourage customers to apply soy sauce from the bottle before leaving the shop instead of opting for single use small, plastic soy fish.  \r\n\r\nWe employ many local staff and ensure we take our responsibilities regarding wages and conditions very seriously.  Our head chef, a Tecoma local, follows a vegan diet and has ensured our menu features a wide range of vegan options.  We endeavour to source ingredients from local suppliers where possible.  We are very much aware of the community we live in and ensure we donate regularly to local schools and sporting and community groups."
