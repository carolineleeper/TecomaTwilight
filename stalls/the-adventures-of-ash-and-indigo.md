description: "Join us on an Adventure!\r\n\r\nThe Adventures of Ash and Indigo is a beautiful monthly letter written in the voice of Ash and Indigo, two kids in the Australian Bush. Each month receive a letter filled with tales from the bush and the garden, exploring seasonal indicators and inspiring nature connection. Each letter includes a personalised hand written and illustrated letter as well as activity ideas or inspiration or resources that link to the stories told.\r\n\r\nThe Adventures of Ash and Indigo is the perfect gift for children of all ages, a gift that will connect rather than clutter, and keep on giving.\r\n\r\nWritten, illustrated and produced created by two local mums and printed on recycled paper."
ethicalDescription: "Our mission is to connect children and families to nature through inspirational story telling. We believe that to nurture the future custodians of our planet we need to guide them in forming a deep connection to the natural world, that will inform the way they interact with the world around them.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge the Wurundjeri and Bunurong people upon whose lands we work and play, and we acknowledge nationally the land upon which we send The Adventures of Ash and Indigo to through including local place names on each letter. \r\n\r\nThe Adventures of Ash and Indigo is printed on recycled paper, even the sticky tape we use on our recycled envelopes is compostable! Any inclusions in the letters are often recycled, repurposed or sustainably harvested."
