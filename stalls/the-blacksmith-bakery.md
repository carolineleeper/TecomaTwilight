description: "The Blacksmith Bakery was started originally by a local pastry chef as Chocolate Sensation in 1997.  We renamed the business to The Blacksmith in 2015 as a nod to the history of the town as it backs on to Blacksmiths Way and the sourdough bread we were making is made by hand the traditional, old fashioned way.\r\n\r\nThe business is open for breakfast lunch and dinner, 7 days a week, 364 days a year."
ethicalDescription: "At the Blacksmith we are very aware of our place in the community.  We employ local people and our customers are mostly locals.  We like to provide sponsorship and donation support to local sporting and community groups and employ many young people as their first job.\r\n\r\nWe are very aware of the impact fast food has on landfill and we try to limit our waste.  We encourage the use of keep cups with a 20c discount if you bring your own keepcup and we also partner with Green Caffeen - a not for profit group - which provides free use of keep cups using a similar system to a library.  You can check cups in and out and that way you dont need to remember to bring your cup with you every time - we have a stash of clean fresh cups that you can take with you.\r\n\r\nWe use paper packaging where possible and switched from plastic to paper for our sourdough breads a few years ago. \r\n\r\nWe employ many local staff and ensure we take our responsibilities regarding wages and conditions very seriously.  Our menu features a wide range of vegan options and we endeavour to source ingredients from local suppliers where possible.  Our coffee roaster is in Lilydale and we use Bills of Belgrave for all our beef and pork.  We are part of the Belgrave Traders committee and donate our time to help keep this volunteer run organisation going to promote the township of Belgrave."
