description: "Since June 2011 The Torch has been providing art, cultural and arts vocational support to Indigenous offenders and ex-offenders in Victoria through its Indigenous Arts in Prisons and Community program.\r\n\r\nThe Torch supports Indigenous men and women both in prisons and post-release in Victoria to explore their Indigenous culture and identity through practising art."
ethicalDescription: "Indigenous men are 15 times more likely to go to prison than non-Indigenous men and Indigenous women are 21 times more likely to go to prison than non-Indigenous women.\r\n\r\nThe Torch has been delivering the Statewide Indigenous Arts in Prisons and Community Program (SIAPC) since 2011. The SIAPC Program is set within the context of the Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement and its focus is on the role of culture and cultural identity in the rehabilitative process of Indigenous prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Torch employs Indigenous Arts Officers to deliver the Program to Indigenous men and women in Victorian prisons and to support participants who are transitioning back into the community.\r\n\r\nOur program aims to reduce the rate of reoffending by encouraging participants to explore identity and culture through art, develop confidence and define new pathways for themselves upon release from prison."
