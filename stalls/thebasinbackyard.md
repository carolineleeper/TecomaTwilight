description: "The Basin Backyard is a small family business and has over 200 bee hives in The Basin, the Dandenong ranges, Gippsland, St Arnauld/Bendigo region and Mornington Peninsula - we provide Bee mentoring, Beekeeping supplies and great honey and honey related products.\r\nAll our honey is cold filtered which leaves in all the beneficial goodness and most of all FLAVOUR"
ethicalDescription: "We dont feed our bees sugar', we take minimal honey as it's their food. We do not harvest pollen or royal jelly as the bees need this for their survival and we are all about caring and working with our bees. Honey is not heated, which removes any benefits (enzymes, pollen) so doesn't change the individual flavours."
