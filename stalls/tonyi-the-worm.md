ethicalDescription: "A Tonyi the Worm Learning Experience aims to empower a new generation to value waste as a resource and learn simple ways to participate in giving back to the Earth with help from the humble composting worm. Tonyi the Worm Incursions also assist educators to set up a wormfarm for ongoing sustainability and regenerative practices.  Tonyi the Worm is an upcycled, handmade creation by local UFTG resident Jasmin Thomas and family. Jasmin shares Tonyi the Worm with permission from Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation. Jasmin is a keen home and community gardener with a Permaculture Design Certificate and volunteers with local community group The Hills Food Frontier where Tonyi makes the occasional appearance at community events and markets."
