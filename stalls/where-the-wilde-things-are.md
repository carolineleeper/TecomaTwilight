description: "Shop Ethically to Live Sustainably ...\r\n\r\nSustainable and ethically made products are at the core of all we do! Beautiful products and enjoyable shopping should not be at the expense of people or the planet.\r\n\r\nWe curate and bring you ethically sourced fashion from Australia and around the world. Every product sourced for its unique beauty and authenticity."
ethicalDescription: "Where The Wilde Things Are was created to share our personal travel experiences with our community, through unique and meaningful products, sourced sustainably from our travels, both around Australia and the world. We source products for their beauty and authenticity, which tell a story about the people who created them and/or the places where we find them. Whether created through age old techniques, or ethical modern methods, all the products we bring to our community are ethical and meaningful.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to give our customers the same joy that we feel when we discover value aligned products from our journeys around the globe.\r\n\r\nAt the core of everything we stand for, you will find sustainable and ethically made products, ensuring that you can shop for, wear and gift beautiful pieces, knowing that your pleasure doesn't come at the expense of our planet, or its global citizens. \r\n\r\nWith the exception of the last few months, I travel to the source of our products, to discover makers, meet the artisans and create meaningful relationships.  \r\n\r\nI have been designing & creating fashion accessories since 1990. I still am very hands on with my own creations under the Wilde at Heart label, also on my website. Everything you see under that label is made in my Melbourne studio, in the Dandenong Ranges."

    product_description: "There is no beauty in the finest cloth if it makes hunger and unhappiness.\r\n-Mahatma Ghandi\r\n \r\n\r\n*** Supporting Zero Waste Fashion \r\n\r\nBecome part of a new chapter in the life of a vintage silk sari jacket or scarf, by choosing from our Once I Was A Sari Collection, where no two pieces are the same.\r\n\r\nThe Once I Was A Sari Collection is a story that spans two continents. Saree traders travel through India, visiting homes to obtain saris no longer required by the original owner. These saris often arrive in textile markets having passed through several hands, where they are graded and sorted for quality, condition, pattern and desirability. Any with threads of silver or gold are most highly prized."
